# Pepper Market Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Analysis of Pepper's customer segmentation strategy, focusing on understanding and serving the small-chested market (AA-B cups) through data-driven insights.

## Latest Analysis (January 17, 2025)
We've refined our segmentation strategy to better align with actual customer sizes and behaviors:

### Size-First Segmentation

   - Primary revenue driver (35.5%)
   - Active lifestyle focus
   - Summer seasonal peak

2. **Core Comfort (30-36 A/B)**
   - Loyal customer base
   - High repeat purchase rate (63.6%)
   - Value-oriented pricing

3. **Fashion Forward (32-36 B)**
   - Premium segment
   - Style-conscious customers
   - Spring/Fall seasonal peaks
