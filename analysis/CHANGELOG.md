# Market Segmentation Analysis Changelog

## [2025-01-17] - Segmentation Strategy Evolution

### Initial Approach (Geographic & Behavioral)
Started with a broad segmentation strategy:
- Core Small-Chested
- Athletic Small-Chested
- Fashion-Forward Small
- International Small
- Value Seekers

**Issues Identified:**
- Too broad, not aligned with actual product offerings
- International expansion not supported by current data
- Value segment unrealistic with fixed price points

### First Revision (Product Line Based)
Attempted to align with product lines:
- Essential Everyday (Signature line)
- Active Minimalist (Zero-G line)
- Confidence Boost (Lift Up line)

**Issues Identified:**
- Product line data structure didn't match our assumptions
- Missing actual product categories and variants
- Lost focus on size-specific needs

### Second Revision (Category & Price Based)
Tried to use product categories:
- Essential Everyday (Basic & Wireless)
- Active Minimalist (Sport)
- Style Seeker (Fashion & Limited)

**Issues Identified:**
- Categories were too generic
- Lost sight of size-specific needs
- Didn't capture the unique value proposition

### Final Approach (Size-First Segmentation)
Realigned with core business focus:
1. **Core Comfort** (30-36 A/B)
   - Primary focus on everyday comfort
   - Target: Daily wear customers
   - Key products: Wireless everyday bras

2. **Petite Active** (30-34 AA/A)
   - Focus on smallest sizes
   - Target: Active lifestyle
   - Key products: Sports and strapless

3. **Fashion Forward** (32-36 B)
   - Style-conscious segment
   - Target: Fashion enthusiasts
   - Key products: Fashion-forward designs

**Key Insights from Evolution:**
1. Stay true to core focus (small-chested customers)
2. Lead with size ranges, then style preferences
3. Maintain premium positioning ($60-65 price points)
4. Focus on differentiation within core market
