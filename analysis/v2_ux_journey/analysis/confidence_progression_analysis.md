Date: 2025-01-19

## Methodology Implementation

### Confidence Score Components
1. **Size Consistency (40%)**
   - Rationale: Primary indicator of customer understanding
   - Measurement: Proportion of consistent size choices
   - Impact: Heavily weights stable size selection

2. **Return Rate (30%)**
   - Rationale: Direct feedback on satisfaction
   - Measurement: Proportion of returns
   - Impact: Penalizes size-related returns

3. **Purchase Frequency (30%)**
   - Rationale: Indicates growing customer comfort
   - Measurement: Days between purchases
   - Impact: Rewards regular engagement

### Implementation Decisions
1. **Weighting Structure**
   - Size consistency weighted highest (40%)
   - Equal weight for returns and frequency (30% each)
   - Rationale: Balances historical and behavioral factors

2. **Score Normalization**
   - All scores clamped between 0 and 1
   - Neutral starting point (0.5) for new customers
   - Linear progression within components

## Initial Findings

### Key Insights
1. **Confidence Development**
   - Most customers show gradual improvement
   - Returns significantly impact confidence
   - Frequency patterns reveal engagement levels

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Clear correlation between consistency and returns
   - Frequency often plateaus after confidence established
   - Size exploration impacts short-term confidence

### Next Steps
1. **Enhancement Opportunities**
   - Add category-specific confidence tracking
   - Implement seasonal adjustment
   - Consider price point impact

2. **Validation Needs**
   - Cross-validate with customer feedback
   - Analyze outlier patterns
   - Test alternative weighting schemes
