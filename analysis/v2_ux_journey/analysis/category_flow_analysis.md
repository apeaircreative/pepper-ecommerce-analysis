# Category Flow Analysis
Date: 2025-01-19

## Methodology Implementation

### Approach
1. **Transition Mapping**
   - Track sequential category purchases
   - Map product IDs to categories
   - Calculate transition probabilities

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Filter significant transitions (>10%)
   - Sort by probability
   - Focus on common paths

### Implementation Decisions
1. **Significance Threshold**
   - Set at 10% of transitions
   - Rationale: Focus on meaningful patterns
   - Impact: Reduces noise in analysis

2. **Sequential Analysis**
   - Consider order timing
   - Track direct transitions only
   - Maintain customer context

## Analysis Components

### Transition Tracking
1. **Category Mapping**
   - Product to category conversion
   - Maintain category hierarchy
   - Handle multi-category products

2. **Probability Calculation**
   - Normalize by total transitions
   - Sort by frequency
   - Filter insignificant patterns

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Common Paths**
   - Identify frequent transitions
   - Track category exploration
   - Note category loops

## Initial Findings

### Key Insights
1. **Category Relationships**
   - Some categories serve as common entry points
   - Others are typically secondary purchases
   - Certain categories show strong connections

2. **Customer Behavior**
   - Category exploration patterns
   - Comfort zone development
   - Category loyalty indicators

### Next Steps
1. **Enhancement Opportunities**
   - Add time-based analysis
   - Consider price point impact
   - Include confidence correlation

2. **Validation Needs**
   - Cross-validate with sales data
   - Analyze seasonal impacts
   - Test alternative thresholds
