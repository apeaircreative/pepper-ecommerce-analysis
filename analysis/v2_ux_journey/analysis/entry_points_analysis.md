## Methodology Implementation

### Approach
1. **First Purchase Identification**
   - Sort orders by date to ensure temporal accuracy
   - Group by customer to identify entry points
   - Focus on initial product choices

2. **Frequency Analysis**
   - Calculate product distribution
   - Convert to ratios for comparability
   - Filter for significant patterns (>10% threshold)

### Key Decisions
1. **Significance Threshold**
   - Set at 10% of customer base
   - Rationale: Focus on patterns with statistical significance
   - Impact: Reduces noise from outlier entry points

2. **Temporal Ordering**
   - Using order_date for sequence
   - Handles same-day purchases appropriately
   - Maintains analysis integrity

## Initial Findings
