## Overview
This analysis aims to understand customer progression through their size confidence journey using post-purchase behavior data. By mapping how customers move from initial purchase to repeat buying, we can identify key patterns that lead to customer success and retention.

## Business Context
- Current situation: Size confidence is crucial for customer satisfaction and retention
- Problem statement: Need to understand how customers develop size confidence over time
- Expected impact: Reduce returns, increase repeat purchases, improve customer satisfaction

## Data Sources
| Source | Description | Date Range | Key Fields |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Orders | Customer purchase history | All available | customer_id, product_id, size, order_date |
| Products | Product details | Current | product_id, category, style, size_range |
| Returns | Return information | All available | order_id, reason_code, size_related |

## Methodology
### Approach
1. Entry Point Analysis
   - Identify first purchase patterns
   - Analyze size selection confidence
   - Map product type preferences

2. Progression Tracking
   - Monitor size consistency
   - Track category exploration
   - Measure purchase frequency

3. Pattern Recognition
   - Identify successful journeys
   - Map common progression paths
   - Note deviation patterns

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Size Confidence Score | (consistent_sizes / total_purchases) * (1 - return_rate) | Measures sizing consistency and satisfaction |
| Journey Progression | days_between_purchases + category_diversity | Tracks customer growth |
| Pattern Strength | frequency_of_pattern / total_customers | Validates pattern significance |

### Assumptions
- First purchase experience significantly impacts journey
- Size consistency indicates confidence
- Category exploration suggests growing comfort
- Return rates reflect fit satisfaction

## Initial Hypotheses
1. Entry Point Impact
   - H1: Certain product types lead to higher confidence
   - H2: Initial size success predicts retention

2. Progression Patterns
   - H1: Most successful customers follow similar paths
   - H2: Category exploration correlates with retention

## Analysis Plan
### Phase 1: Entry Points
```python
def analyze_entry_points():
    """
    1. Group first purchases
    2. Calculate success rates
    3. Identify optimal entry products
    """
```

### Phase 2: Progression Tracking
``` python
def track_progression():
    """
    1. Map purchase sequences
    2. Measure confidence development
    3. Identify key transitions
    """
```

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition
``` python
def identify_patterns():
    """
    1. Cluster journey types
    2. Measure success rates
    3. Document key findings
    """
```

## Expected Deliverables
1. Journey Maps
- Entry point distribution
- Progression pathways
- Success patterns

2. Metrics Dashboard
- Confidence scores
- Progression rates
- Pattern strength

3. Recommendations
- Product positioning
- Size guidance
- Category introduction

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement entry point analysis
- [ ] Create initial visualizations
- [ ] Document first findings
- [ ] Review with portfolio focus

### Future Considerations
- Machine learning for pattern prediction
- Real-time confidence scoring
- Personalized journey recommendations
