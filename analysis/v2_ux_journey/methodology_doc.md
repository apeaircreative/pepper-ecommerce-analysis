# How We Understand Our Customers' Journey

## Our Approach to Customer Data

### Understanding Purchase Stories
- We look at orders from our most recent customer interactions
- Each order tells us about product choices and fit preferences
- We carefully track when customers decide to return items
- We connect each order with detailed product information

### Learning from Size Choices
- We understand size preferences from product details
- Common formats include sizes like "34B" or "36A"
- We separate band and cup sizes to better understand fit
- We're careful not to make assumptions about missing information

### Return Experience
- We track returns at the individual item level
- We confirm returns based on customer decisions
- This helps us understand fit satisfaction better

## How We Map Customer Journeys

### Starting Points
1. We group orders by customer to see their story
2. We identify their first experience with us
3. We look at which products new customers trust
4. We focus on patterns that help many customers (>5% of experiences)

### Understanding Growing Confidence
We measure customer confidence through:
1. Size Consistency (40%)
   - How often customers find their perfect fit
   - We don't judge new customers or single purchases
2. Return Experience (30%)
   - Based on actual customer decisions
   - Lower returns suggest higher satisfaction
3. Shopping Comfort (30%)
   - How customers develop their shopping patterns
   - More frequent shopping often shows growing confidence

### Style Exploration
1. We connect products to style categories
2. We follow how customers try new styles
3. We measure what makes transitions successful
4. We identify patterns that help customers succeed
