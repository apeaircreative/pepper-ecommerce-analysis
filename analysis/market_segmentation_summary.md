## Initial Queries

### 1. Product Distribution
```sql
-- Size distribution analysis
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN RIGHT(sku, 3) SIMILAR TO '(30|32|34|36)(AA|A|B)' THEN 'Core'
        ELSE 'Extended'
    END as segment,
    COUNT(*) as product_count,
    AVG(retail_price) as avg_price,
    COUNT(DISTINCT id) as unique_styles
FROM transformed_products
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 2. Revenue Analysis
```sql
-- Revenue by segment
SELECT 
    p.segment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.user_id) as customers,
    SUM(o.sale_price) as revenue,
    AVG(o.sale_price) as aov
FROM transformed_order_items o
JOIN transformed_products p ON o.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 4 DESC;
```

### 3. Customer Retention
```sql
-- 90-day retention by segment
WITH first_purchase AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        segment,
        MIN(created_at) as first_order_date
    FROM transformed_order_items o
    JOIN transformed_products p ON o.product_id = p.id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
retention AS (
    SELECT 
        fp.user_id,
        fp.segment,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as retained
    FROM first_purchase fp
    LEFT JOIN transformed_order_items o ON 
        o.user_id = fp.user_id 
        AND o.created_at BETWEEN fp.first_order_date AND fp.first_order_date + INTERVAL '90 days'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
    segment,
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    SUM(retained) as retained_customers,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(retained) / COUNT(*), 2) as retention_rate
FROM retention
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 4 DESC;
```
