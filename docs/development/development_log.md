## Duplication Investigation Findings (Jan 16, 2025)

#### Key Findings
1. **Customer Records**:
   - 96,096 customers (96.6%) have duplicate records
   - Each customer has 1-17 duplicate IDs (avg: 1.03)
   - Most duplicates are exact copies (same city/state)

2. **Order Patterns**:
   - Same order appears multiple times for same customer
   - Order timestamps are identical across duplicates
   - Clear case of data denormalization, not actual duplicate orders

3. **Location Analysis**:
   - Only 122 customers have multiple locations
   - Most have 2 locations, max is 3
   - Likely represents customer moves/multiple addresses

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Data Structure Issue**:
   - Tables appear to be denormalized exports
   - Each customer-order combination creates duplicate customer records
   - Not a data quality issue, but a storage design choice

2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - No data loss risk from deduplication
   - Need to preserve customer location history
   - Can safely deduplicate using customer_unique_id

#### Solution Strategy
1. **Create Cleaned Views**:
   ```sql
   -- Base customer view
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `pepper-analytics-2024.transformed_data.vw_customers_clean` AS
   SELECT DISTINCT
       customer_unique_id,
       FIRST_VALUE(customer_id) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_unique_id ORDER BY customer_id) as customer_id,
       customer_city,
       customer_state
   FROM `pepper-analytics-2024.raw_data.olist_customers`;

   -- Base order view
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `pepper-analytics-2024.transformed_data.vw_orders_clean` AS
   SELECT DISTINCT
       o.order_id,
       c.customer_unique_id,
       o.order_status,
       o.order_purchase_timestamp,
       o.order_approved_at,
       o.order_delivered_carrier_date,
       o.order_delivered_customer_date,
       o.order_estimated_delivery_date
   FROM `pepper-analytics-2024.raw_data.olist_orders` o
   JOIN `pepper-analytics-2024.transformed_data.vw_customers_clean` c
   ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
   ```

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Create cleaned views 
   - Add data quality metrics to pipeline
   - Document deduplication logic
   - Update integration strategy for TheLook
